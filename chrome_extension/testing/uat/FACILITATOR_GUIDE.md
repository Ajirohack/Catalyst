**Script**: "Thank you for participating in this testing session for the Catalyst Whisper Coach extension. Today, you'll be helping us evaluate how well this tool works for improving digital communication. I'll guide you through several tasks, and I'd like you to share your thoughts aloud as you work. There are no right or wrong ways to use the extensionâ€”we're testing the tool, not you. Your honest feedback is extremely valuable."

### 2. Task Facilitation (45-60 minutes)
