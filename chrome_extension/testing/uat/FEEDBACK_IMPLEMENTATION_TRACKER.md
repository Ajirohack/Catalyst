# Catalyst Whisper Coach - UAT Feedback Implementation Tracker

## Overview

This document tracks feedback gathered during User Acceptance Testing and the implementation plans for addressing this feedback. It serves as a central reference for the development team to prioritize and track changes based on user input.

## Feedback Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels

1. **P0 - Critical**
   - Blocks core functionality
   - Causes data loss or security issues
   - Prevents users from completing essential tasks
   - Implementation timeline: Immediate (24-48 hours)

2. **P1 - High**
   - Significantly impacts user experience
   - Affects main features but has workarounds
   - Reported by multiple users
   - Implementation timeline: Short-term (1-2 weeks)

3. **P2 - Medium**
   - Moderately impacts user experience
   - Affects secondary features
   - Has reasonable workarounds
   - Implementation timeline: Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

4. **P3 - Low**
   - Minor UI/UX issues
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Affects a small percentage of users
   - Implementation timeline: Long-term (Next release cycle)

5. **P4 - Consideration**
   - Feature requests or enhancement ideas
   - Requires further research or planning
   - May be considered for future roadmap
   - Implementation timeline: Future consideration

### Evaluation Criteria

Each piece of feedback is evaluated based on:

- **Impact**: How significantly it affects the user experience
- **Frequency**: How many users reported the issue
- **Effort**: The development resources required to implement
- **Strategic Alignment**: How well it aligns with product goals
- **User Value**: The potential benefit to users
