# Catalyst Whisper Coach - UAT Data Analysis Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a structured approach for analyzing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) data collected during the testing of the Catalyst Whisper Coach extension. It outlines methodologies for processing both quantitative and qualitative data to derive actionable insights.

## Data Sources

Before beginning analysis, ensure you have collected data from all sources:

1. **Pre-Test Questionnaires**: Baseline information about participants
2. **Task Completion Forms**: Performance metrics for specific tasks
3. **Daily Usage Journals**: Ongoing feedback during self-guided testing
4. **Post-Test Surveys**: Comprehensive feedback after testing completion
5. **Focus Group Transcripts**: In-depth discussions about user experiences
6. **Issue Reports**: Technical problems and usability concerns
7. **Screen Recordings**: Visual documentation of user interactions
8. **Analytics Data**: Usage patterns and feature engagement metrics

## Quantitative Data Analysis

### System Usability Scale (SUS) Calculation

1. For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):
   - Subtract 1 from the score (Score - 1)

2. For even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10):
   - Subtract the score from 5 (5 - Score)

3. Add all converted scores and multiply by 2.5 to get a score out of 100
   - Formula: SUS = (Sum of converted scores) × 2.5

4. Interpretation:
   - Score > 80: Excellent
   - Score 68-80: Good
   - Score 68: Average
   - Score 51-67: Poor
   - Score < 51: Unacceptable

### Net Promoter Score (NPS) Calculation

1. Categorize responses:
   - Promoters: Scores 9-10
   - Passives: Scores 7-8
   - Detractors: Scores 0-6

2. Calculate percentages of each category
   - % Promoters = (Number of Promoters ÷ Total Respondents) × 100
   - % Passives = (Number of Passives ÷ Total Respondents) × 100
   - % Detractors = (Number of Detractors ÷ Total Respondents) × 100

3. Calculate NPS
   - NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

4. Interpretation:
   - NPS > 50: Excellent
   - NPS 30-50: Good
   - NPS 0-30: Needs improvement
   - NPS < 0: Concerning

### Task Completion Metrics

1. Success Rate:
   - % of participants who completed the task successfully
   - (Number of successful completions ÷ Total attempts) × 100

2. Average Time on Task:
   - Sum of all completion times ÷ Number of participants

3. Error Rate:
   - Average number of errors per task attempt
   - Total errors ÷ Number of attempts

4. Satisfaction Rating:
   - Average of satisfaction scores for each task

### Feature Satisfaction Analysis

1. Calculate average satisfaction rating for each feature
2. Calculate usage rate (% of participants who used the feature)
3. Rank features by satisfaction and usage to identify strengths and weaknesses
4. Cross-tabulate with participant demographics to identify patterns

## Qualitative Data Analysis

### Thematic Analysis

1. **Data Familiarization**:
   - Read through all textual data multiple times
   - Create initial notes about potential patterns

2. **Code Generation**:
   - Tag relevant text segments with descriptive codes
   - Use a consistent coding framework across all data sources

3. **Theme Identification**:
   - Group related codes into potential themes
   - Create a thematic map showing relationships between themes

4. **Theme Review**:
   - Check if themes accurately represent the coded extracts
   - Ensure themes tell a coherent story about the data

5. **Theme Definition**:
   - Name each theme and write a clear definition
   - Identify sub-themes where appropriate

6. **Report Production**:
   - Select representative quotes for each theme
   - Explain the significance of each theme

### Sentiment Analysis

1. Categorize feedback as positive, negative, or neutral
2. Identify emotional intensity (strong, moderate, mild)
3. Track sentiment across different aspects of the extension
4. Note changes in sentiment over the testing period

### Content Analysis

1. Count frequency of specific terms, issues, or suggestions
2. Identify patterns in how users describe their experiences
3. Compare language used across different participant groups
4. Note discrepancies between quantitative ratings and qualitative descriptions

## Data Integration

### Triangulation Methods

1. **Data Triangulation**:
   - Compare findings across different data sources
   - Identify consistencies and contradictions

2. **Investigator Triangulation**:
   - Have multiple analysts review the same data
   - Compare interpretations and resolve differences

3. **Methodological Triangulation**:
   - Compare results from different data collection methods
   - Assess how findings complement or contradict each other

### Mixed Methods Integration

1. **Explain**:
   - Use qualitative data to explain quantitative findings
   - Example: Why a feature received low satisfaction ratings

2. **Expand**:
   - Use one data type to expand insights from another
   - Example: Quantitative usage patterns expanded by qualitative descriptions

3. **Compare**:
   - Directly compare quantitative and qualitative results
   - Note convergence or divergence between data types

## Prioritizing Findings

### Impact-Frequency Matrix

Create a matrix with:

- Vertical axis: Impact on user experience (High, Medium, Low)
- Horizontal axis: Frequency of occurrence (High, Medium, Low)

Place each finding in the appropriate cell and prioritize as follows:

1. High Impact, High Frequency: Critical priority
2. High Impact, Medium Frequency: High priority
3. Medium Impact, High Frequency: High priority
4. High Impact, Low Frequency: Medium priority
5. Medium Impact, Medium Frequency: Medium priority
6. Low Impact, High Frequency: Medium priority
7. Medium Impact, Low Frequency: Low priority
8. Low Impact, Medium Frequency: Low priority
9. Low Impact, Low Frequency: Lowest priority

### Implementation Difficulty Assessment

For each recommended change, assess:

1. Technical complexity (High, Medium, Low)
2. Resource requirements (High, Medium, Low)
3. Timeline implications (Long, Medium, Short)

Create an Effort-Impact matrix to prioritize changes that offer high impact for low effort.

## Reporting Results

### Data Visualization

Effective charts and graphs for UAT reporting:

1. Bar charts for feature satisfaction comparisons
2. Line graphs for trends over time
3. Pie charts for demographic breakdowns
4. Radar charts for multi-dimensional comparisons
5. Heat maps for identifying problem areas
6. Word clouds for qualitative theme visualization

### Narrative Development

Structure the narrative around:

1. Key strengths to maintain and leverage
2. Critical issues requiring immediate attention
3. Opportunities for enhancement
4. Long-term strategic considerations

For each finding, include:

- Clear description of the finding
- Supporting evidence (data, quotes)
- Implications for users and product
- Specific recommendations

## Statistical Analysis (For Larger Sample Sizes)

If the sample size permits (generally n > 30), consider these additional analyses:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Mean, median, mode
   - Standard deviation
   - Range and interquartile range

2. **Inferential Statistics**:
   - T-tests for comparing groups
   - ANOVA for multiple group comparisons
   - Correlation analysis for relationships between variables
   - Regression analysis for predictive relationships

3. **Segmentation Analysis**:
   - Compare results across different user segments
   - Identify significant differences between groups
