# Catalyst Testing Strategy

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive testing strategy for the Catalyst platform, covering both frontend and backend components.

## Testing Philosophy

The Catalyst testing approach follows these core principles:

1. **Test Early, Test Often** - Tests are integrated into the development process from the beginning
2. **Pyramid Approach** - More unit tests than integration tests, more integration tests than E2E tests
3. **Realistic Coverage** - Tests mirror real user behavior and scenarios
4. **Automation First** - All tests are automated and run in CI/CD pipelines
5. **Performance Matters** - Performance testing is an integral part of the testing strategy

## Testing Architecture

### Frontend Testing

The frontend testing architecture consists of:

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions in isolation using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests** - Test multiple components working together
- **Component Tests** - Visual testing of components using Storybook
- **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user flows using Cypress
- **Performance Tests** - Measure and ensure good application performance
- **Accessibility Tests** - Ensure the application is accessible to all users
- **API Tests** - Test API integration without UI interaction

For more details, see [Frontend Testing Guide](frontend/TESTING.md).

### Backend Testing

The backend testing architecture consists of:

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests** - Verify that different parts of the backend work together correctly
- **API Tests** - Verify that the API endpoints return the expected responses
- **Performance Tests** - Measure the performance of critical backend operations
- **Security Tests** - Verify that the API is secure

For more details, see [Backend Testing Guide](backend/tests/README.md).

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline includes:

1. **Linting and Static Analysis** - Ensures code quality and consistency
2. **Unit and Integration Tests** - Verifies functionality at the component level
3. **E2E Tests** - Verifies functionality at the system level
4. **Performance Tests** - Ensures the application meets performance requirements
5. **Security Scans** - Checks for vulnerabilities

## Test Environments

### Local Development

- Local database with test data
- Mock external services

### CI Environment

- Isolated test database
- Mock external services

### Staging Environment

- Production-like database with anonymized data
- Staged versions of external services or sandboxed APIs

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Developers** - Write unit and integration tests, fix failing tests
- **QA Engineers** - Write E2E tests, perform exploratory testing
- **DevOps** - Maintain test infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines
- **Product Managers** - Define acceptance criteria and test scenarios

## Tools and Technologies

### Frontend

- Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- Storybook for component development and visual testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Axe-core for accessibility testing

### Backend

- Pytest for unit, integration, and API tests
- Locust for load testing
- Bandit for security scanning

## Reporting and Metrics

- **Test Coverage** - Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- **Test Success Rate** - Track percentage of passing tests
- **Bug Escape Rate** - Track bugs found in production
- **Test Execution Time** - Optimize for fast feedback loops

## Best Practices

1. **Write Testable Code** - Design with testing in mind
2. **Test Business Logic** - Focus on testing business logic rather than implementation details
3. **Keep Tests Fast** - Optimize for quick feedback
4. **Maintain Test Independence** - Tests should not depend on each other
5. **Use Realistic Test Data** - Use data that reflects real-world scenarios
6. **Monitor Test Quality** - Regularly review and improve tests
