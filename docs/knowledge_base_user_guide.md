The system will automatically:

   - View document metadata (type, size, creation date)
   - Manage tags
   - Download the original document
   - Delete the document

## Searching the Knowledge Base

### Basic Search

1. Enter your search query in the search box on the left sidebar
2. Click the search button or press Enter
3. View results ranked by relevance

### Advanced Search

For more targeted results:

1. Apply filters before searching:
   - Select a category from the dropdown
   - Select one or more tags
2. Enter your search query
3. Click the search button

### Understanding Search Results

Search results show:

- The most relevant passages from documents
- Similarity score (relevance to your query)
- Document title and metadata
- Tags associated with the document

Click "View Document" to see the full document.

## Analytics

The Analytics tab provides insights about your knowledge base:

- Total number of documents
- Document types distribution
- Popular tags
- Storage usage
- Recent activity

Use these insights to better organize and manage your knowledge base.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Organizing Documents

- Use consistent naming conventions for categories
- Create a tagging strategy that makes sense for your team
- Regularly review and update tags and categories

### Improving Search Results

- Use specific search terms
- Include key phrases in your query
- Apply filters to narrow down results
- If results are too broad, try adding more specific terms
- If results are too narrow, try removing some terms or filters

### Document Processing

- For best results, ensure documents are text-searchable (OCR for scanned documents)
- Break large documents into logical sections before uploading
- For better organization, add tags during upload rather than relying on auto-tagging

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues

- Ensure your document is under the maximum file size (50MB)
- Check that the file format is supported
- If OCR fails for images, ensure the text is clear and readable

### Search Issues

- If search returns unexpected results, try rephrasing your query
- Ensure your document was successfully processed (check status)
- If a document isn't appearing in search results, try reindexing it

## Advanced Features

### Document Chunking

Large documents are automatically split into smaller chunks for more precise search results. Each chunk is indexed separately, allowing the system to return the most relevant sections of large documents.

### Semantic Search

The Knowledge Base uses advanced vector embeddings to understand the meaning behind your queries, not just matching keywords. This means you can find relevant information even when the exact words aren't present in the document.

### Hybrid Search

For optimal results, the system combines semantic search with traditional keyword matching, giving you the best of both worlds.
