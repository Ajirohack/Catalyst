## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Validation

- [ ] Verify document upload functionality

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Identify the nature of the issue (frontend, backend, database)
2. If frontend-only, revert to previous frontend version
3. If backend-only, revert to previous backend version
4. If database-related, restore from last known good backup
5. Communicate status to users during the rollback process
